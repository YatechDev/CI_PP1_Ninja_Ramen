## Design

### Design Choices
As a design for the website, I did not use ready-made colour palettes, and instead, I decided to choose themed photos as
the background for each of the subpages.  
Each of the main subpages has its photo, with a layer blurring the background and emphasizing the content of the page.  
In addition, the navbar and footer are in grey shades that match the style of the rest of the site.

Below is a list of photos selected for each subpage.

<details><summary>Home</summary>
<img src="docs/backgrounds/bg-home.webp" alt="Background for Home-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>About</summary>
<img src="docs/backgrounds/bg-about.webp" alt="Background for About-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>Menu</summary>
<img src="docs/backgrounds/bg-menu.webp" alt="Background for Menu-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>Gallery</summary>
<img src="docs/backgrounds/bg-gallery.webp" alt="Background for Gallery-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>Contact</summary>
<img src="docs/backgrounds/bg-contact.webp" alt="Background for Contact-Page">
</details>

Pages "404" & "ThankYou" don't have specific photos, instead, they have a black background.


### Fonts
'Roboto' regular 400 - taken from Google Fonts and apply via @import method to CSS file.  
I chose this font because of its popularity, simplicity and ease of reading.

![FONT](docs/font.png)

### Structure

The website is constructed in one of the most frequently chosen and user-friendly ways. At the top of the page, there is
a navigation bar with links to other subpages, below the main content of the page and a footer at the bottom.

The website consists of five main pages and two additional pages.

- Home
- About
- Menu
- Gallery
- Contact

and

- 404 page
- Thank You page

navigation bar highlights the selected page where the user is located.
On the left side, there is a logo that, when clicked, leads to the main page. The navigation bar is responsive to mobile
devices - it then turns into a common in-use "hamburger menu".

- User Stories covered: 2, 14, 16, 17

### Hero Section & Restaurant Goals
![HERO SECTION](docs/features/feat-hero_section.png)
![Restaurant Goals](docs/features/feat-restaurant_goals.png)
The section on the main page is a first eye-catcher. It contains a short description of the restaurant,
thanks to which the user learns what cuisine the restaurant has to offer.
In the section, we can see two buttons that lead to the menu of the restaurant and additional information about the
restaurant.
The section also includes logos and photo thumbnails for attention and additional visual effect.  

Immediately below the section, there are restaurant goals, which are quick to read and are designed to arouse the
curiosity and interest of the user to continue browsing the site and take advantage of the restaurant's offer.

- User Stories covered: 1, 8, 14, 15, 17

### Footer
![FOOTER](docs/features/feat-footer.png)
Footer, like the navigation bar, is present on all subpages and is responsive to mobile devices. It contains links to
restaurant's profile on the most popular social media, opening hours, contact details and copyrights.  
Links to social media are shown as icons, making it easy to find a platform that interests the user.
The links open in a new browser tab, so the user stays on the restaurant's website.

organization of meetings and events in the restaurant.

### Menu
![MENU](docs/features/feat-menu.png)
The section contains the restaurant's menu and is divided into categories. Each of the categories contains a drawing of
the dish, which is hidden on mobile devices to ensure greater comfort in viewing the offer.  
Each dish has a short description and price.

## Validation

### HTML Validation

I used "W3C Markup Validation Service" to validate the code.  
I validated each of the subpages and no error was found on any of them.

<details><summary>Home</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation-home.png" alt="Validation of Home-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>About</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation-about.png" alt="Validation of About-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>Menu</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation-menu.png" alt="Validation of Menu-Page">

<details><summary>Gallery</summary>

<details><summary>Contact</summary>

<details><summary>404</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation-404.png" alt="Validation of 404-Page">
</details>

<details><summary>ThankYou</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation-thankyou.png" alt="Validation of ThankYou-Page">
</details>

### CSS Validation

I used "W3C CSS Validation Service" to validate the CSS code.

I have performed two validations:

1. The Whole page showed errors and alerts related to imported CSS code from Font Awesome but showed no errors with my
   CSS.

<details><summary>Whole Page</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation_whole_page_css.png" alt="Validation of Whole Page CSS">
</details>

2. During the second validation I loaded my CSS file and the program did not find any errors related to my code, it only
   suggested that the imported CSS sheet (google font) was not checked.

<details><summary>My CSS file</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/validation-my_css.png" alt="Validation of My CSS file">
</details>

## Testing

### Accessibility

I used "The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool" to test the code for accessibility and the same error
appeared on each of the subpages.
The label for input has an icon in it for a "hamburger menu" purpose, and has no other content. The tool treats this as an
error.  
No other errors were detected on any of the subpages.

<details><summary>Home</summary>

<details><summary>About</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>ThankYou</summary>
<img src="docs/accessibility/access-thankyou.png" alt="Accesibility of ThankYou-Page">
</details>

### Performance

To test the performance on the website, I used Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools.
The test was carried out on all subpages, both for computers and mobile devices.  
Below is a list of screenshots:
